# Scrapping Website with Selenium Webdriver and Python

I am testing Selenium on a Map-based website. Here I used DKV Maps (https://www.dkv-euroservice.com/DKVMaps/)

# Setup
1. Download and add the driver (chromedriver.exe) to the project location. Link: (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)
2. Run requirements.txt pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Change LOCATION_AREA to your desired location

# Result
The script will perform live scrapping and save data to a CSV file automatically.
